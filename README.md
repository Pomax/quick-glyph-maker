# A quick glyph maker

I needed a quick outline drawing tool for a blog post I'm writing about making fonts, and needed something that would let me draw and turn that into a fully clipepd SVG outline. Couldn't find it, so I had to roll it myself, and so I did, using @humph's most excellent "Bramble" in-browser-full-code-editor (it's Adobe's Brackets, but heavily massaged into running in the browser with a full file system and live previews. You should check it out). The clipping is achieved with `clipper.js`, a port of the C++ `clipper` library hosted over on sourceforge.
